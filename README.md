# Pathfinder

## Description 
A website that allow users to customize their endpoints and obstacles on a map and show an animation of how an algorithm (e.g. Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm) finds the shortest path. 

Check out this web app here: https://pathfinding-visualizer-ae94a.web.app/

## How to use
For a quick start, click on two grids.

Then, click on "Run Pathfinding Algorithms" and choose an algorithm you want to find the shortest path with.

Now you can see how the algorithms find the shortest path between two grids!

Click twice on a grid to make it an obstacle.

You can also choose to quickly build a maze, aka placing obstacles "smartly", from one of the maze generation algorithms by clicking on "Generate Maze" and choose one algorithm.

Now you can watch how our algorithm builds a maze! You can put two start/end grids on this new maze and run the pathfinding algorithm as well!

Finally, to reset our board, click on "Reset board" on the nagivation bar.

Enjoy pathfinding!
